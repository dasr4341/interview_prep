when ever a execution context is created, a lexical environment is also created 
 - lexical environment = local memory + lexical environment of its parent.
 - lexical means a order/ hierarchy

 whole chain of lexical env is scope chain


closure - 
is the bundle of its local scope + its lexical environment
