    Extract the company name and funding raised in numbers from the following text.
    If the text does not contain both a company name and a funding amount, respond with "null" only, else give JSON structure like in examples.
    If the text talks about multiple funding, respond with "null" only. Like in Example 4
    If the text talks about any place that is outside United States, respond with "null" only. Like in Example 5, Barcelona is outside US
    If the text has inconclusive company name like in Example 5, respond with "null" only.
    If the text looks like a person name like in Example 8, respond with "null" only. You can be leniant for this rule. If you are unsure to determine company name with person name, you should respond with the JSON structure. Only if you are very sure, you should give null value. Like in Examples 10 and 11, although there are people's name, the company name is clear.
    In cases like Example 10 and 11. There are high chances that the company name is 'W' instead of 'Jake Paul's W'

    Format the response as a JSON object with the following structure: {"companyName": string, "fundingRaised": number}
